# Women Transforming Tech Networking

Video: How to Think about Networking

* Humans are two different things that need to be connected by a path through which we can send communications
* Networking: how to create a path between us and another person for communication
* Networks are as fragile as the amount of time and effort put into the care and maintenance of the connections
* Ask what you can do for your network

* Find one point where common stories converge
* Professional network:
  * Not necessary to know people on the personal level
  * If it does not work, just move on
* Personal network:
  * Wanting to know more about them
  * Wanting to learn something from them
* Steps to start networking:
  1. Do your research to identify who to connect with
  2. Look for smaller opportunities around the larger events
  3. Engage with the conference speakers
  4. Focus on what you can learn at networking events



Video: Who to Network With

* Networking as a map model: various ways to connect to a person&#x20;
* Downside of networking within your industry: not expanding the amount of information or connections you have through them
* Within your industry, network with people at higher levels than your role
* Outside of your industry, network with people with diverse skill sets



Video: Strategies for Networking Success

* Networking questions to ask yourself:
  * What am I learning through this connection?
  * Would I want to work with this person?
* Networks and communities require constantly tending and cultivating for them to be healthy
* Group your network connections
  1. Core network:
     * About your support system
     * Not about careers or jobs
     * Intentional about sustaining the relationships
  2. Current network:
     * People important to you for the time you are in
     * Connect with them on social media
     * Find something to do together to sustain the relationships
  3. Broader community:
     * Weaker ties
     * Keep them healthy by connecting them to other people, who can care for them
* Networking is about building trusted relationships



Video: Connecting Others

* Be authentic
* Help people
* When connecting someone, ask yourself these questions:
  1. Can my identity help to connect others?
  2. Can my experience help build connections?
  3. How can my location build connections?
