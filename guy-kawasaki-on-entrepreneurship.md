# Guy Kawasaki on Entrepreneurship

Video: Focusing on Your Pitch

* Business plans are too long and delusional
* Great pitch, about 10 slides, to explain the gist of your company
* Relatable and conceivable pitch: perspective, vision, outlook and hope, etc.

Video: Creating a Prototype

* Not focus on: writing a business plan in Word, creating a financial projection in Excel & creating a pitch with PowerPoint
* Focus on: making a prototype
* Ask people to use your prototype and collect their feedback
* Instead of going to the investors and tell them that you can build something, you can tell them you have built the prototype
* MVP: minimal viable product

Video: How to Pitch Successfully

* Do research to know if your information is relevant to the person being pitched to
* With prototype or release or first permutation of product
* Short, 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30-point font

Video: Economic Bubbles

* Bubbles impact entrepreneurship funding
* Dumb ideas can also get funded during the bubbles
* A bubble is a good thing if you get out before it pops

Video: Providing Value

* Provide something valuable
* Difficult to predict what will turn out to be valuable

Video: Predicting New Markets and Opportunities

* Dubious to predict a new market
* The way entrepreneurship works: a few people in a garage/spare office build a product together and knock on wood that other people in the market would want it too

Video: Writing “The Art of Social Media”

* Fine to repeat your tweets

Video: Gaining Followers on Social Media

* Post good quality stuff
* Make your posts engageable
* Be bold, take a stand but avoid a deep end
* Practice good karma and give credits to your sources

Video: Evolution of Social Media

* About all visual marketing
