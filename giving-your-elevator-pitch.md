I’ve been working with them mostly in support of the brand development team for one of their package-goods divisions.} {\[_future aspirations_] I love the work, but I’ve begun to think more about the big picture, so I’m looking for opportunities to move into management roles.}”
* Example: “My background is manufacturing, mostly high tech. Right now, I’m the general manager of a large facility for GenTech. We’re an electronic components company headquartered in Hong Kong.
